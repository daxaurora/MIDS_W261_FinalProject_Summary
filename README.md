# MIDS_W61_FinalProject

Final Project for Machine Learning at Scale Course for UC Berkeley's Master of Information and Data Science

This project uses a MapReduce algorithm written from scratch in Spark that applies gradient descent to logistic regression for predicting online ad click-through rate. Unit testing in Juptyer Notebook; final implementation on distributed cloud infrastructure via Google DataProc.

This repository holds a PDF of the final Jupyter Notebook with a full description of the project and all code written to implement the project.  The original development code is in a private repository.
